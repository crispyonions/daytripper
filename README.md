Daytripper

Daytripper is a web application that helps users find travel destinations based on their interests that are within a day's trip of their location. Users can register an account to access the Trip Finder, which allows them to select their interests and the length of trip they're able to fit into their day. The application will return a list of matching destinations with an option to save them to the user's Trip Page. Users can click on a saved trip to link to a third-party site for more information about that location. Additionally, users have an option to submit new day trips for review, and the admin can review and add/delete the trips that have been suggested.

Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Start the server using npm start.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Usage
To use the Trip Finder, register an account or log in. Select your interests and the length of trip you're able to fit into your day. The application will return a list of matching destinations. You can save trips to your Trip Page and view them later. If you have a new day trip suggestion, you can submit it for review.
